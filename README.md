# ARTI-308_lab1
First lab focused on practicing Git and GitHub fundamentals.
Hi,I’m Najla Alsemari!

I am currently a student studying Cybersecurity, with a strong interest in technology and problem solving. I am especially interested in machine learning and how it can be applied to real-world applications. Through this course, I hope to gain experience with machine learning concepts, tools, and collaborative development using Git and GitHub. In my free time, I enjoy learning new technical skills,drawing, and exploring topics related to Cybersecurity and AI.

Looking forward to learning more about machine learning in ARTI 308!
